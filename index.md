## Open letter of support for community members targeted by Jon Pretty

We, the undersigned, have become aware that, for some time, Jon Pretty has abused his position of privilege and stature within the Scala community to sexually harass and victimize women. He has used the community’s conferences to target women who are new to the Scala community, offering mentorship, access, and other forms of support, and then abusing the trust that he has established.

We state this based on multiple, independent, well-substantiated reports showing a systematic pattern of behavior over an extended period.

Mr. Pretty’s behavior is unacceptable. It is morally repugnant on its face. It directly damages the women involved, sometimes causing lasting trauma. It also indirectly damages the Scala community by creating a more toxic environment, especially for women and newcomers.

We demand that Mr. Pretty cease using technical gatherings, within the Scala community or elsewhere, to prey on women. We request that any organization in which Mr. Pretty serves in a leadership or advisory capacity immediately cut ties with him. We call upon organizations and conference organizers to strengthen their codes of conduct to explicitly forbid such behavior.

We further resolve that:

* We will not support the efforts of any party in the Scala community that provides a platform to Mr. Pretty. That includes, but is not limited to, boycotting events the party organizes and refusing to buy any product or service the party offers.
* We will not attend any conference or user group meeting organized or attended by Mr. Pretty.
* We will not attend any conference or user group meeting that does not have a code of conduct that is both specific (it must not allow predatory sexual advances in professional spaces) and actionable (it must provide a safe and accessible reporting mechanism for people who have been targeted).
* We will not use or promote any software artifacts that are maintained by Mr. Pretty.

We encourage others to adopt these same resolutions.

Our purpose in releasing this open letter is to bring attention to the issue and to limit the ability of Mr. Pretty and others to use their reputations and influence within the industry as cover for sexually predatory behavior.
